# First-Portfolio-V1

## Description

Using HTML and CSS I developed my first portfolio :tada: which provides potential employers with access to my contact information, as well as the ability to view projects I've worked on.

This portfolio exhibits my skill in use of flexbox as well as media query to allow users to view my portfolio across several devices :computer: :iphone:.

This portfolio will be updated frequently as I develop more projects and further improve my skillset in HTML, CSS and other programming languages. 

Check out my [portfolio](https://disantoz.github.io/First-Portfolio-V1/)! Reach out to me via the contact information if you want to connect, and offer advice on how I can improve my portfolio or be a better developer.
