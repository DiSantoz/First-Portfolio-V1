        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a former Rutgers graduate with a background in Criminal Justice and Psychology who decided to flip the switch and turn developer. After several years of gaining vast knowledge in the financial, security and law sectors I always felt I never had a fulfilling job or direction on where I was headed. 
            That was until last year when the pandemic hit and I found myself at home looking to improve my skillset and keep myself entertained. I stumbled upon Code Academy and Udemy and took a couple of starter coding courses. I was hooked! Creating something from nothing, fixing bugs, the "ah-ha!" moment, I enjoyed every second of it.
            Well I found something I enjoyed and wanted to improve my skillset and definitly needed something with more structure, so I joined a bootcamp and I've been coding ever since. 
        </p>

            Enough about how I got here, you probably want to know what can I do. Well take a look at my portfolio, you'll see several projects that show off my skillset in HTML, and advance CSS. Even this portfolio is an example of my skillset.
            I love video games, love tech and how its ever evolving, and I enjoy making my ideas a reality. Feel free to contact me if you like what you see.
